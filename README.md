Yeah, my entire code works. Your suggested use of hvplot and KMeans produces errors that exist only in Narnia. Please suggest actually relevant ways to produce visualizations, Trilogy needs major help in the curriculum development realm. I have stumped over 5 different AskBCS mentors with these errors in fixing and updating all iterations of hvplot installed on my computer.
